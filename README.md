A CRASH_OUT.txt file appears
A config file should be present. It should be named LTIconfig.cfg You can create this with any text editor:

Setup: Config file contains 4 lines:
 * 1 - FTP Server address
 * 2 - The name of the last set of files received
 * 3 - The name of the log file (future versions may have more sophisticated log management)
 * 4 - The date this process was last run successfully (either in the logs- or just create one yourself)
 The date is just to make sure that time has passed since the program was run.

Example:

ftp://ftp.librarytech.com/
